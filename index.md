# Hi, Iâ€™m Anna.

Iâ€™m a product leader with roots in computer science, a foundation in systems and support, and a natural progression into product ownership through curiosity, initiative, and clear thinking. My career has always lived at the intersection of structure and empathy. I care about how things work, how people experience them, and how to make both better.

I work on complex internal platforms, where success is less about shiny new features and more about trust, clarity, and long-term usability. I lead calmly, think in systems, and focus on building shared understanding across roles and disciplines.

## The Work I Do

I help teams understand what weâ€™re doing, why it matters, and how the parts fit together. That might mean clarifying a decision, mapping a workflow, or translating business goals into something engineers can actually build. Iâ€™m usually the one holding the whole picture and making sure weâ€™re still working on the right problem.

I pay attention to the parts of the process that create friction (unclear priorities, misaligned expectations, gaps between teams) and I try to address them without adding more overhead.

I do a lot of writing. Not just specs, but internal documentation, product updates, onboarding guides. Things that help people feel confident and informed.

I ask questions until we get to the real issue. I don't assume the ticket is the problem.

And I try to do all of that in a way thatâ€™s calm, honest, and sustainable. Thatâ€™s how I want the work to feel.
