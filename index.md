title: Anna Pinneo | Product Manager

# Hi, I'm Anna.

I'm a product manager who brings clarity, structure, and empathy to complex systems. I thrive in ambiguity and help teams ship not just features — but trust, usability, and sustainable practices.

## What I Care About
- Solving the root problem, not the surface request
- Creating alignment in messy systems
- Listening closely and leading with clarity
- Long-term product health > short-term wins
