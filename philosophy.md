## What Guides My Product Work

You can’t improve something you don’t understand. So I start with context — the users, the system, the history, the things that aren’t written down. I ask a lot of questions. I try to understand how things actually work before I decide how to change them.

And I pay attention to the quiet work: the documentation, the decisions, the conversations that don’t happen in a standup. That’s where trust is built. That’s where clarity comes from. That’s what holds a product together over time.


## What I Believe

- The ticket is rarely the real problem  
- “What should we build?” is often the wrong first question  
- Users are experts in their own pain, even if they can’t describe the solution  
- Shipping is just one part of a good release - rollout, communication, and follow-through matter just as much  
- Internal trust is a product too  
- Being the calmest person in the room is usually more useful than being the loudest

## How I Make Decisions

I don’t follow one framework or method. I ask a lot of questions. I try to surface assumptions. I write things down so the conversation doesn’t reset every week.

When a request comes in, I look for the underlying friction. Is this a symptom of something deeper? Do we actually understand the problem? Has this come up before? What’s the real impact?

I’m comfortable working in ambiguity, but I try to reduce it for others. My goal isn’t just to ship features — it’s to help the team feel like they know why we’re building what we’re building, and how to talk about it when someone asks.

## Where I’m Still Learning

**Designing for scale**  
I’ve spent a lot of time making things work within messy systems. Now I’m learning to think upstream — to design systems, features, and decisions that still make sense a year (or five) from now.

**Measuring what matters**  
I rely heavily on user instinct and qualitative signals, but I’m deepening my comfort with metrics and learning how to pair empathy with data to tell clearer stories and spot patterns I might miss otherwise.

**Letting systems carry the weight**  
I’m learning how to document and structure my work in ways that make it durable — so others can pick things up, run with them, and still feel confident, even if I’m not in the room.

**Sharing what I know**  
I’ve absorbed a lot just by doing the work, and I’m learning how to articulate it. In documentation, in mentorship, in writing. Not just what I’ve done, but how I think and why it worked.

**Zooming out**  
I’ve gotten really good at solving the problem in front of me. Now I’m learning to ask bigger questions — about the market, the strategy, and the long game — and figuring out how to tie daily decisions to a larger story.
