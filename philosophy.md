# Product Philosophy

I believe good product management starts with listening â€” not just to requests, but to friction, confusion, and patterns users might not even know how to name.

My job is to connect the dots between what's needed, what's possible, and what's sustainable. That means solving real problems, not just fulfilling feature requests.

I care deeply about:
- Usability and clarity
- Long-term product health
- Transparent communication
- Designing for trust, not just function
