# About Me

Hi, I'm Anna. I'm a product manager with a foundation in computer science, a passion for usability, and a knack for finding clarity in messy systems.

### A few things I care about:
- Connecting dots across disciplines
- Building structure where there is none
- Turning user feedback into scalable improvements
