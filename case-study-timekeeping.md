# Building a Planning Model from the Ground Up

When I joined the company, product development operated without a roadmap. There was no intake process, no defined prioritization, and no shared framework for deciding what to build. Feature requests from clients were routed directly to engineering — often informally, and without cross-functional input.

If a request was feasible, it was typically approved. There was no evaluation of tradeoffs, no alignment across departments, and no way to surface competing priorities.

As a result:

- The platform experience became fragmented and inconsistent  
- Engineering was frequently pulled into ad-hoc work  
- Clients learned to expect custom features as a default  
- Internal teams lacked visibility into what was being built — or why


## Approach

### System Mapping & Process Design

I led a full analysis of how work was sourced, requested, and delivered. Through collaboration with support, sales, and engineering, I mapped current-state request flows and identified breakdowns across intake, evaluation, and prioritization.

I then designed and implemented:

- A centralized intake model for client requests  
- A collaborative scoring system to assess value and feasibility  
- A biannual prioritization framework aligned with company and product strategy  

### Cross-Functional Implementation

To ensure consistency and adoption:

- I developed clear documentation, visual scoring tools, and request flow diagrams  
- Facilitated collaborative evaluation sessions across departments  
- Worked with engineering leadership to integrate effort estimates into prioritization  

### Change Management & Stakeholder Alignment

Shifting from a reactive model required both structural and cultural change. I partnered with account teams to communicate the shift to clients and set new expectations around feature evaluation. Internally, I facilitated alignment sessions to help teams understand how and why the new process worked — and how it would benefit them long-term.

## Outcomes

Within the first two prioritization cycles:

- Ad-hoc development requests decreased by more than 80%  
- Engineering gained sustained time for roadmap features and technical investment  
- Internal teams aligned around a shared language for product value  
- Clients began offering clearer, more strategic feedback  

## Reflection

This initiative redefined how product decisions were made across the company. It wasn’t just about saying “no” more effectively — it was about introducing a structured way to say “yes” to the right work, with clarity and alignment.

It also reinforced the value of durable systems: ones that create visibility, build trust, and scale decision-making beyond a single person or conversation.
