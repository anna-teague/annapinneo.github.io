# Case Study: Timekeeping Workflow That Fell Flat (And What I Learned)

**The Problem:**  
Clients were consistently requesting improvements to our timekeeping workflow. The existing setup was unclear, and support tickets were increasing.

**What I Did:**  
We updated documentation, introduced a new system pop-up, and launched the feature. Adoption initially stalled. I brought the project to marketing, crafted user-facing content, and helped account teams position the change clearly.

**What Changed:**  
Adoption improved. Support tickets dropped. But more importantly — I learned that a product launch is never just the release. It's about rollout, communication, and closing the loop with users.
